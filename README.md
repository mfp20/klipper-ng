# klipper-ng
### Klipper Next Gen, a general purpose Firmata-based MCU firmware and its 3D printer host application.

## WARNING: not working (yet).

If you don't know what Klipper is, explore that project first: [Klipper by Kevin O'Connor](https://github.com/KevinOConnor/klipper). If you are searching for a 3D Printer firmware, that's the way to go.

The proper description of this project can be infered from the git log. But you can find a more verbose description, some history, my motivation and reasoning, in the [wiki](https://github.com/mfp20/klipper-ng/wiki). I try to keep the public code in good conditions (ie: it builds and doesn't crash) but sometimes I don't have enough time to go up there before pushing a new commit. Apologies.

Last but not the least: I'm using github as backup, just in case my computer goes boom. And I'm using github tools (ex: issues, wiki) to explore github itself. So I'll be adding issues, labels, milestones, and so on to figure out github project management capabilities. A Solo job. Austism. Wan... you got the point. Because life gotta be fun, funny and fucking hilarious.

Jokes apart, if you want to test, implement, contribute have a look at the [contributing page on the wiki](https://github.com/mfp20/klipper-ng/wiki/Contributing).
